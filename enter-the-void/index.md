    <a>WELL DONE, NOBLE GUIDE. YOU HAVE DISCOVERED MY FIRST SECRET.</a>

    <a>IT STARES BACK CUSTOM MAP EDITOR</a>
  </strong>
</p>

&nbsp;BUILD YOUR OWN MAP! We might even put one in the pack if it‚Äôs fun!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>
    <a>FOR OUR PROTECTION</a>
  </strong>
</p>

&nbsp;IT STARES BACK is still under development. It is possible elements of community submitted maps will make their way into the final game, either intentionally or by coincidence. By submitting a map to the community, you are forfeiting creative ownership of it. That said, community maps will credit their creator, provided the creator adds their name to the level description.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>
    <a>GETTING STARTED</a>
  </strong>
</p>

&nbsp;Note: If you experience any trouble loading up a level, double check this list. Any misspellings will break the editor.

&nbsp;-The ‚ÄúEditor‚Äù button will unlock on the main menu once you have started Dreams of the Makers.

&nbsp;- Create a Directory( folder) titled  "ItStaresBack" in your documents folder

&nbsp;-Download the ‚ÄúISB Map Templates‚Äù folder, as seen above, and drop it into ‚ÄúItStaresBack‚Äù, and unzip the file

&nbsp;-Launch It Stares Back. The Editor menu should now have levels available to select. If it does, congrats you did it! Now you can get on with the fun part!

&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/3Jfc7C2" target="_blank">-If you have any trouble then take some screenshots and consult our Discord community for assistance.</a>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>
    <a>THE FUN PART!</a>
  </strong>
</p>

&nbsp;Again, if you experience any trouble loading up a level, double check your syntax. Any misspellings or additional spaces will break the editor.

&nbsp;Everything else is only recommended reading. You might have more fun learning through your own experimentation like the mad scientists you are. So go crazy! Asking questions in our Discord is encouraged. That said, people who ask questions already answered in this document will likely be told to ‚Äúcease thy insolence and consult the tome of legend.‚Äù

&nbsp;It is recommended that you create a backup folder for spare levels so you may easily replace anything you break. Any folders not titled ‚ÄúLevel1‚Äù-‚ÄùLevel10‚Äù will not appear in the editor. Don‚Äôt let this limit you, however. Create as many folders as you want in the directory and simply trade out as you need.

&nbsp;-Okay, so these folders might look like a bunch of crazy code nonsense. Don‚Äôt worry, to make a level, you only need to know three things to get makin‚Äô and sharin‚Äô.

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>
    <a>MAP</a>
  </strong>
</p>

&nbsp;Every pixel represents a hex. The color denotes what type of hex. Just open that file up in any pixel image editing software to paint your pixel map. MS paint works fine! Photoshop is our preference, but be your dreams. Use the color picker to select from the Map of Legend and paint! Make sure to use the pencil tool to fill things in. Any pixels not matching the exact color legend will break the level. New Colors will be added to the Legend over time.

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>
    <a>FOGMAP</a>
  </strong>
</p>

&nbsp;Black is fog, white is not fog. Use and shade of grey to get as intricate as you want. Just don‚Äôt use color in this image and make sure the dimensions match your Map.png.

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>
    <a>Description</a>
  </strong>
</p>

&nbsp;The top line is your level title. The second line is the creator‚Äôs name. The third line is the template type. The fourth is the description. That‚Äôs literally it. Everything else is extra curricular.

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>
    <a>Everything Else</a>
  </strong>
</p>

&nbsp;‚ÄúSpeechX‚Äù- Editor maps have had all dialogue audio removed from them, but you can still make characters appear in-game and say goofy stuff in text.

&nbsp;EventsConfig- pink hexes are events. Can be found in the bottom left of the legend.

&nbsp;GlobalEventsConfig- events that are not tied to hexes, like winning and losing and whatnot.

&nbsp;LevelConfig- a few other parameters not tied to event hexes.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>
    <a>COMMUNITY CONSTRUCTION RULES</a>
  </strong>
</p>

&nbsp;If your map does not meet within these guidelines, we will not put it in a community map pack.

&nbsp;Share and upload whatever you want in the discord. We will not put your map in a pack unless your permission has been granted. We are not required to put your map in a pack even if it meets all the rules. If your map is not selected we are not required to explain why.

&nbsp;These rules are subject to change as we add new features. We‚Äôve got some cool stuff planned.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;- EventsConfig and GlobalEventsConfig must match one of the available templates

&nbsp;- Map must fit within template dimensions (100x75 pixels)

&nbsp;- Map must be bordered by at least one pixel of void. Use void to make your map as big or small as you want within those confines, but‚Ä¶

&nbsp;- ALL NON VOID SURFACES MUST CONNECT by at least one hex. Avoid void islands.

&nbsp;- Do not spell dirty words or make lude shapes. I know it‚Äôs tempting. Once we have the separate editor built, you can make whatever you want on your own time.

&nbsp;- Level must be beatable within reason.

&nbsp;- Level must have some degree of challenge to it. Don‚Äôt give the player 400 dye to start with, please.

&nbsp;- Every pixel color must match the legend. Unregistered hex colors will break the level.

&nbsp;- Player will fail the level if they run out of stone. Provide enough to win.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>
    <a>SUGGESTED LIMITS</a>
  </strong>
</p>

&nbsp;These suggestions are what we've found make for ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù levels, but some rules are made to be broken. Feel free to not follow these guidelines. Thinking outside the box is encouraged!

&nbsp;- 2 player castle limit. Player can always build more

&nbsp;- 4 regular or haunted ruin limit (haunted ruins will activate when revealed)

&nbsp;- 15 lit or unlit spire limit. So lit, fam.

&nbsp;- 10 discover five lost soldiers event limit

&nbsp;- 10 discover five clamorings event limit

&nbsp;- 4 discover five iron clamorings event limit

&nbsp;- Keep basic land below 40% of your map. Use other hex types to fill

&nbsp;- No more than 5 dye, iron, coal, or crystal. No more than 8 total.

&nbsp;- No limit on trap hexes (water, ice, lava, electric, or void) so go crazy, but avoid large sections the player must cross to win, especially ice.

&nbsp;- No limit on haunted trees, but avoid massive clusters the Guide must clear to win, especially early level. Keep clusters below 8. Exceptions may vary.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <a>SUBMISSION</a>
  </strong>
</p>

&nbsp;Once you‚Äôre ready, upload your three files (Map, Fogmap, Description) to our #map-makers thread in our discord and tell us a little about it.

&nbsp;If you‚Äôve made some wacky changes to events or other level files, feel free to share them as well! It is unlikely we‚Äôll use it in a community map pack, but we are thrilled to see all the crazy stuff you all play around with.
