&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**What is it exactly!?** Mission Adventure is perfect for getting kids out of the house and active (although grown ups can have a lot of fun with it too)! One person - The Route Setter - sets a route on the map to follow. It could be around a local park or a family trail. You know, that place you've wanted to visit and haven't managed to drag the kids to yet!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Destination set!** The app will then lead the group on a crazy adventure around this route using the map to navigate, making interesting choices, answering questions or just running for it. Honestly it's a blast! My kids can’t seem to get enough of it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Where are we now?** We have 3 packs just about ready to go: "Pirate Adventure," "Alien Adventure," and "Guinea Pig Adventure"! The plan is to have 2 more packs ready by August. Current front runners being "Spy Adventure" and "Fairy-tale Adventure."  Presuming there is demand, we hope to regularly update the app with further Adventures over the next year. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Your Mission!** Support our Kickstarter! A little community investment at this point would allow us to; give our app the polish it deserves in time for a summer launch, put in some full time coding effort ,and pay our studio artist to make it nice and shiny. That’s all it will take to get us from "fun side project" to "real app store contender".
