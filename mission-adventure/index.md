&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**What is it exactly!?** Mission Adventure is perfect for getting kids out of the house and active (although grown ups can have a lot of fun with it too)! One person - The Route Setter - sets a route on the map to follow. It could be around a local park or a family trail. You know, that place you've wanted to visit and haven't managed to drag the kids to yet!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Destination set!** The app will then lead the group on a crazy adventure around this route using the map to navigate, making interesting choices, answering questions or just running for it. Honestly it's a blast! My kids canâ€™t seem to get enough of it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Where are we now?** We have 3 packs just about ready to go: "Pirate Adventure," "Alien Adventure," and "Guinea Pig Adventure"! The plan is to have 2 more packs ready by August. Current front runners being "Spy Adventure" and "Fairy-tale Adventure."  Presuming there is demand, we hope to regularly update the app with further Adventures over the next year. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Your Mission!** HAVE FUN PLAYING!
