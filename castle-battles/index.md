Castle Battles is a Real Time Strategy Game with the colorful look of medieval fantasy remixed. LightArc Studios has condensed the mechanics of classic top-down strategy games to create a fast paced style of play like no other. Expand your empire by building castles near bountiful resources, collect gold to amass outlandish armies, and swarm your enemies in 40 unique levels.

Explore the eccentric world of “The Great Tapestry” through four story-rich campaigns: Fight to reclaim your lost homeland as Les Moustachiers. Laugh maniacally as The Clearly Evil Empire. Discover the astral mysteries of The Purperilous. And finally, set out on a hero’s journey as The Order of Awesome to stop the narrative from unraveling.
