&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weave your fate into The Great Tapestry! **Light Arc Studio**, a developer and publisher of interactive entertainment, today announced that their fast-paced action strategy RPG, Castle Battles is scheduled for release on the Apple App Store and Google Play for iOS and Android devices in spring 2017.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/568370/">Castle Battles</a>** streamlines the mechanics of classic, top-down strategy RPGs to create a fast-paced style of gameplay like no other. Players will expand their empire by building castles near bountiful resources, collect precious gold to amass outlandish armies, and then swarm their enemies across 40 unique levels.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explore the illustrated world of “The Great Tapestry” through 4 story-rich campaigns: Players will fight to reclaim their lost homeland as Les Moustachiers. Laugh maniacally at their opponent's folly as The Clearly Evil Empire. Discover the astral mysteries of The Purperilous. And finally, set out on a hero’s journey as The Order of Awesome in order to stop the narrative from completely unravelling.
