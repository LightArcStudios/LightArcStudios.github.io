&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Light Arc Studio** has streamlined the mechanics of classic, top-down strategy to create a fast paced style of gameplay like no other. Expand your empire by building castles near bountiful resources, collect gold to amass outlandish armies, and swarm your enemies in 40 unique levels.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explore the illustrated world of “The Great Tapestry” through four story-rich campaigns: Fight to reclaim your lost homeland as _Les Moustachiers_. Laugh maniacally as _The Clearly Evil Empire_. Discover the astral mysteries of _The Purperilous_. And finally, set out on a hero’s journey as _The Order of Awesome_ to stop the narrative from unraveling.
